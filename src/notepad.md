# Open Todos

## CompanyDetail

TODO: currently priniting error out on screen -- Not an end user error to show
 Currently shows a 200 response due to how React handles it -- even if its a 404 from the backend
 Should redirect (Navigate Component) OR could make a reusable 404Component to show instead
 This helps for UX AND for SEO

## CompanyList && JobList

TODO: Search is handled here, would need to keep track of search term
from SearchForm to track its use here (So it stays in the search field on SearchForm submission)
